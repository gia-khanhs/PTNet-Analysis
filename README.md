# PTNet-Analysis
A recursive link to the repo: [PTNet-Analysis](https://github.com/gia-khanhs/PTNet-Analysis)

This is my own implementation of the research paper [A comparative study of topological analysis and temporal network analysis of a public transport system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S204604302100037X)

- To make the coding process easier, these libraries were used: turfpy, geojson (to work with geographical information).
- Installation: 
```pip install turfpy geojson psutil```

- The report of the project is private.
